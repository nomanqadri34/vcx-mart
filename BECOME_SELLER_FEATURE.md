## Technical Implementation

### Routing

```javascript
// Public route - accessible to all users
<Route path="/become-seller" element={<BecomeSeller />} />
```

### Authentication Handling

```javascript
// Redirects to login if not authenticated, preserves intended destination
const handleStartSelling = () => {
  if (!user) {
    navigate("/login", { state: { from: "/seller/apply" } });
    return;
  }
  navigate("/seller/apply");
};
```

### Role-based Logic

- Automatically redirects existing sellers to seller dashboard
