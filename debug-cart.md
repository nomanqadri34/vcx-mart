# Cart Debug Information

## Backend Status: ✅ WORKING
From server logs, we can see:
- Cart is being saved correctly in session
- Session ID is consistent: `yIvqiUNPuUAuSVcXgkM0MfSj4eQnKR-N`
- Cart data structure is correct:
```json
{
  "productId": "68b054639562879c50bdfb78",
  "quantity": 5,
  "variants": { "size": "XS", "color": "black" },
  "price": 1000,
  "name": "men shirt",
  "image": "https://res.cloudinary.com/dfisnbg4l/image/upload/v1756386394/products/WhatsApp_Image_2025-08-22_at_15.51.35_4cb8bc4f_tj8zat.jpg",
  "seller": "68a9bfbd97024ffa051fd95e"
}
```

## Frontend Issue: ❌ FRONTEND PROCESSING
The issue is likely in one of these areas:

### 1. Browser Console Check
Open browser developer tools (F12) → Console tab
Look for these debug messages:
- `CartPage: Current state:`
- `cartAPI.getCart: Making request...`
- `cartAPI.getCart: Response received:`
- `CartContext: loadCart response:`
- `CartReducer: SET_CART action payload:`

### 2. Network Tab Check
- Check if GET `/api/v1/cart` request is successful
- Verify response contains cart data
- Check if cookies are being sent with request

### 3. Possible Issues
- Response data structure mismatch
- State not being updated in React context
- Items array not being set correctly
- Loading state preventing render

## Next Steps
1. Open localhost:5173/cart in browser
2. Open F12 Developer Tools
3. Check Console and Network tabs
4. Share what you see in the debug logs
